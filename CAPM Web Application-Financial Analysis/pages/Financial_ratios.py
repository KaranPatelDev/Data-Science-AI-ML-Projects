# Additional information and explanation
st.markdown(""" 
### Explanation of Financial Ratios:
- **P/E Ratio**: Measures the price investors are willing to pay for a dollar of earnings. A high P/E indicates high growth expectations.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. A lower ratio suggests less risk.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Measures profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.
- **Current Ratio**: Indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. A ratio above 1 means the company can cover its short-term liabilities.
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: Indicates how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings. A higher ROA indicates better asset efficiency.
